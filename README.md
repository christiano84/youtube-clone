Please be aware that this was sourced from a tutorial video, it was not written completely from scratch on my own.

This video was instrumental in helping me to understand the layout of a website and how you can re-create ANY layout by using a 'box' model.
After finishing the practice exercises on my own from this video (my html-css-exercises repository) and recreating the YouTube layout in HTML / CSS
I became much more familiar with Media queries, CSS Flexbox and absolute positioning.

The tutorial is online here:
