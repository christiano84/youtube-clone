Please be aware that this was sourced from a tutorial video, it was not written completely from scratch.

This video was instrumental in helping me to understand the layout of a website and how you can re-create ANY layout by using a 'box' model.
I uploaded the practice exercises I did from this video as well (my html-css-exercises repository.)
